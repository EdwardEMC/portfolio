# Assignment2
A responsive website portfolio featuring an about me page (index), a portfolio page with interactive topic images/links and a contact page complete with a message form.

# Getting Started
The index page shows the majority of the information nessecary about the candidate in question. As a responsive layout the text field will decrease in width as the height of the element grows to accomodate the text wrapping around the profile picture. At the predetermined screen size (576px) the padding/margin for the content boxes is removed in order to give mobile users the full use of their screens.

The portfolio page is a place to showcase the upcoming apps to be built. The images are responsive to hover and the links are currently not connected but ready to be. As the window is minimised the photos decrease in size to the point (576px) of stacking one ontop of another.
